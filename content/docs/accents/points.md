## Input

| Input            | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **_unit input_** | feed a gate signal into the left side of the unit |

## Controls

| Control     | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **time x**  | time to reach point x                        |
| **level x** | level of point x                             |
| **curve x** | curvature of the segment approaching point x |

## Options

### Held Gate

sustain will sustain at level 3 when it is reached if the gate is still high
loop will jump immediately back to point 1 when point 3 is reached, and loop from point 1 to 3 as long the gate is high

## Retrigger

When the envelope is retriggered before it has completed itâ€™s full cycle:
analog will begin the first phase from the level of the envelope at the moment is retriggered
digital will force the envelope to level 4 before beginning the first phase

### Views

There are various views to help you focus on particular aspects of control
all, time/level, levels, times, curves and a view showing all of the relevant controls for each segment [1-4]

## Other Stuff

Attached is a PDF of some sketches of a few ideas you could try with Points, and a zip file of Points unit presets with those ideas already built. Recommended installation path for the presets is /er-301/v0.6/presets/points
