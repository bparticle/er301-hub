I am pleased to introduce <em><strong>LINUX</strong></em>
<md-img src="LINUX/ea98cc3934ac29dfbd74ad1940eb38f47b22885d.png" alt=""></md-img>
<em>Linux</em> is a special <em>4 channels mono mixer</em> with some interesting
features <strong>to animate</strong> boring signals.<br />
some may recall pedals like Moog Midi Murf or modules like MI Frames but it is
slightly different. Try it with different audio sources.<br />
It can however be used as a simple mixer with 4 inputs and a mono output, for
this it must be loaded on a mono channel, and this is very useful, especially
when you run out of mixers and vca&rsquo;s in your system.
<em>(CPU around 18%)</em>

Download linux.UNIT from the side bar, (56.1 KB) 

## Function

## Preview

Here is a small preview of the unit: In the videos I simply inserted the 4

waveform outs from my Tip-Top Audio z3000 VCO into the Linux inputs. In this
clip the z3000 i sequenced by a Malekko Voltage Block.

In this clip simple 4 waveform from z3000.

If you put any audio source on the 1/4 inputs, the bias faders will function
like normal mixer faders and Very clean signals will come out. But the fun
begins when you activate <strong>SCAN</strong>. In fact the same will activate
the sample&amp;hold driven by white noise. Also remember that
<strong>SCAN</strong> can be driven simply by an external clock inserted on
G1.<br />
Below is a small recap on the main functions:

<strong>VCA:</strong> is a simple on/off | panic command.<br />
<strong>SCAN:</strong> will activate the channel scan in random world.<br />
<strong>SPEED:</strong> adjusts the speed of kaos applied to the activation /
deactivation of channels.<br />
<strong>SLEW:</strong> applies a proportional amount of modulation&rsquo;s
portamento of the channels. Routing<br />
<strong>G1:</strong> External clock input<br />
<strong>IN1/4:</strong> Mixer input<br />
<strong>A1-B1-C1-D1:</strong> Envelope input Feel free to experiment, destroy
and reassemble it as you please.<br />
I hope you enjoy it.
