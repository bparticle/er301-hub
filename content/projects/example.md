## Example project

This project is not listed on the home page but you can access it directly at http://er301-hub.netlify.app/projects/example

This markdown file is intended for short inline unit descriptions and docs. Units will be listed on top of the project page and automatically link to headers that bear the same name as the unit. For example the "Other unit" unit title will link to the next header

## Other unit

You can use images, provided you have added them to the `/static/images` folder with the following syntax:

<md-img src="my-project/exampleimg.jpg" alt=""></md-img>

And you can use YouTube videos like this:

<div class="yt-embed">
  <youtube :video-id="'66MMMyfIy50'"></youtube>
</div>

## Last unit

For longer documentation, patch examples and demos, it might be fun to experiment with the dedicated documentation pages. You can add a markdown page in the `/content/docs/example` folder (that may need creating if it doesn't exist) with the same name as your unit. Sanitize the unit name by using only lowercase characters and replacing spaces with hyphens.
