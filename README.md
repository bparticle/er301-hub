this site is a testing environment for the Orthogonal Devices ER-301 sound computer community code hub. The goal of the app is organizing and sharing patches, presets, packages and documentation between users and developers. The original forum discussion is here [Package management, distribution, organization - V0.6](https://forum.orthogonaldevices.com/t/package-management-distribution-organization-v0-6/5280?u=bparticle)

## Nuxt content

For managing and displaying content from different contributors, we are using the [Nuxt content submodule](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). Contributors can pull the code, add their files to the static assets folder and add a simple yaml file with metadata. the code and manually add their content in subfolders.

The master branch is continuously deployed on Netlify. As soon as the pull request is merged the changes are live. üéâ

## Organization

Organizing the different packages, units, presets and matching them with different firmware versions is currently what I'm trying to conceptualize in my head. Stay tuned. üòÅ
