        CardOne is an archive of eclectic samples assembled by ER-301 users.
        Samples were either discovered from freely available sources on the
        internet, or created by the the users themselves with hardware/software
        that they own. To the best of our knowledge, we believe the samples to
        be free to use in any music production. You are not allowed to sell or
        otherwise redistribute the samples.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-3 pb-3">
        Most directories contain a PDF or TXT file that sites that source for
        the samples, as well as anything else the contributor wanted you to
        know. We recommend unzipping the archive to your SD card in the
        ER-301/samples directory.
